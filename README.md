# EMPATHY PREDICTION USING MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON

*"Most people think empathy is something that you reserve for your life, your family or your friends but the reality is that it is an existential priority for a business. Our business is to meet unmet, unarticulated needs of our customers. There is no way that innovation is gonna come out if we donâ€™t listen to the words and understand the true meaning behind them by being empathetic."* - **Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft**

In this project, the task is to recruit student volunteers to help with Alzheimer's patients. To recruit a good bunch of volunteers, it is very important to know how empathetic they are. The project deals with the predictions of the empathy levels of the students on a scale of 1 to 5 from the survey results aquired from the `Young People Survey` dataset obtained from `Kaggle`. 

## Steps to execute the project :

1) Download the entire <a href="https://github.com/VETURISRIRAM/MULTI-LAYER-PERCEPTRON-MACHINE-LEARNING">repository.</a>

2) Please find the dataset from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey/">link.</a>

2) Open Powershell or Command Window in the directory where the files are downloaded/saved.

3) Execute the following command to see the working of the project - `python main.py` or run the `main.py` file in whichever platform you use.

4) You can find various other things like visualizations, in-depth analysis of the dataset and learning curves that I tried in the Jupyter <a href="https://github.com/VETURISRIRAM/MULTI-LAYER-PERCEPTRON-MACHINE-LEARNING/blob/master/EmpathyPredictions.ipynb">Notebook.</a>

Also, the conclusions are based on the evaluations and the insights drawn from the technical research paper - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05394.pdf">'A Closer Look at Memorization in Deep Networks'</a> by several Deep Learning scholars from MIT and Google. The justification for the conclusions are provided in the Jupyter <a href="https://github.com/VETURISRIRAM/MULTI-LAYER-PERCEPTRON-MACHINE-LEARNING/blob/master/EmpathyPredictions.ipynb">Notebook.</a>


## Common Issue and Work-Around

If the Python Notebook does not load in the browser or you see something like `Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?`, you can open it <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/VETURISRIRAM/MULTI-LAYER-PERCEPTRON-MACHINE-LEARNING/blob/master/EmpathyPredictions.ipynb">here<a>.
