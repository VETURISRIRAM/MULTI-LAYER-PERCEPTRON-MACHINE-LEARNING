# EMPATHY PREDICTION USING MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON

In this project, the task is to recruit student volunteers to help with Alzheimer's patients. To recruit a good bunch of volunteers, it is very important to know how empathetic they are. The project deals with the predictions of the empathy levels of the students on a scale of 1 to 5 from the survey results aquired from the Young People Survey dataset obtained from Kaggle. 

Steps to execute the project :

1) Download the entire repository.
2) Please find the dataset in the following link : https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey/
2) Open Powershell or Command Window in the directory where the files are downloaded/saved.
3) Execute the following command to see the working of the project - "python main.py" or run the 'main.py' file in whichever platform you use.
4) You can find various other things like visualizations, in-depth analysis of the dataset and learning curves that I tried in the Jupyter Notebook named 'EmpathyPredictions'

Also, the conclusions are based on the evaluations and the insights drawn from the technical research paper - 'A Closer Look at Memorization in Deep Networks' by several Deep Learning scholars from MIT and Google. The justification for the conclusions are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.
